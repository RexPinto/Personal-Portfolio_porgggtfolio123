# Rex Pinto - Portfolio

## Summary

The page is designed to be visually appealing and responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Setup Instructions

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage Guide

The website is designed for easy navigation. The header contains links to different sections of the page:

*   **About Me:** A brief introduction about Rex Pinto.
*   **Skills:** A list of relevant technical skills.
*   **Projects:** Examples of projects Rex Pinto has worked on.
*   **Contact:** Contact information for Rex Pinto.

## Code Explanation

*   **index.html:** This file contains the structure of the webpage. It includes the header, navigation, sections for "About Me", "Skills", "Projects", and "Contact", and a footer.  The HTML uses semantic elements for better accessibility. A background image from the attached URL is also incorporated into the body.

*   **style.css:** This file contains the CSS styles for the webpage. It defines the layout, colors, typography, and responsiveness of the page.  A key feature is the `background-attachment: fixed` property, which creates a parallax scrolling effect with the background image. It also includes media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens, ensuring a responsive design.

*   **script.js:** This file is intentionally left empty for this minimal example.  In a more complex portfolio, this file could be used for adding interactive elements, animations, or dynamic content loading.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript (minimal)
